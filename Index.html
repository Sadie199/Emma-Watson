            <h1>HI!</h1>
            <p>
                Emma Watson, youngest actor to play in Harry Potter, played the role of the intellegent 'Hermione Granger',
                smartest witch of her age. She has played several other roles, and started acting when she was only 
                11 years of age. Out of 11,396 people trying out for Hermione, Emma was the one hand-picked by J.K Rowling herself.
                Selected for Gryffindor, she has spoken numerous times---saying that Slytherin or Ravenclaw would have been a better
                choice for her.
